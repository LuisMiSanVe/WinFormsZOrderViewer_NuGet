NuGet Package that lets you add a Control in your WinForms Project to view and modify the Z-Order of its Controls.

## 🛠️ Setup
Install the NuGet in the Marketplace or clone this repos to debug/fork it.

## ⚙️ Project Usage Explanation
Open a WinForms Project then go to the Toolbox, you'll find a new `WinFormsZOrderViewer` section with one Control, add it to your Form.

This new Control works similar to the `ToolTip`, as when added to the Form, all of its Controls will have a new attribute where you can view and change the Z-Order of them easyly.

As Z-Order counter is closer to 0, the Control gets closer to the Top and vice versa.

New major features and critical bug fixes will cause the immediate release of a new version, while other minor changes/fixes will wait one week from the time the change is introduced in the repository before being included in the new version, so that other potential changes can be added.
>[!NOTE]
